#Pomodoro timer with multi monitor support#

Set work and break periods, and opacity.  During the breaks, all monitors will darken to the 
opacity level.  

*TODO: fade to opacity before taking focus.  This would give you a few seconds to get to a good 
stopping point before losing focus, and being forced to take a break.

*TODO: display remaining time in system tray.
